Welcome to the Tech Hub repository!

This project is a web application that helps users discover nearby parks based on their current location. Users can filter parks within a specific radius (2km, 5km, or 10km) and search for parks by name. If the searched park falls within the selected radius, it will appear in the suggestions. Upon selecting a park, users can view detailed information about it.
